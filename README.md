# Web AppEngine-OnlineReceipt (No database-incompleted)
This is my first web application in python using flask.

# Real-life scenario
1. A customer goes shopping.
2. He requests an email receipt by filling his card details.
3. Their email address is typed on the till.
4. App asked if they'd like to link his email address to his card details by creating an account, so that it doesn't
have to be typed again when he will visit the shop again.
5. When they do visit again, their email address is suggested based on their card number and
can be selected from a list of suggestions instead of being typed.
