# Web AppEngine-OnlineReceipt (No database-incompleted)
This is my first web application in python using Flask. However, the database is not set up yet, so the login function does not work.

# Real-life scenario
1. A customer goes shopping.
2. He requests an email receipt by filling his card details.
3. The email address is typed on the field.
4. The app is asking if he'd like to link his email address to his card details by creating an account. In this way. the customer will not have to type his card details again.
5. Next time, when the user will visit the store, his email address will be suggested based on his card number, then it can be selected from a list of suggestions instead of being typed.

# Installation
To use this template, your computer needs:

1. Python 2 or 3
2. Flask (pip install flask)
3. Browse in the folder (e.g. using cmd)
4. Running the app, type "python app.py" (e.g. in cmd)
5. Browse to the IP which the console shows
